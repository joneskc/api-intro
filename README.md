## Objectives

- Explain what an API is
    - Application Programming Interface. It's a way for us to interact with other pieces of software
    - internal API: things that are native to a language. fetch itself: asynchronous requests.
    - AJAX asynchronous javascript and XML
    - external API: usually a server and a database that exists on someone else's machine. we can request data from the server, server queries the database and then the server packages up data and sends it to us
- Use fetch to GET data from an external API
- Append data from a fetch request to the DOM

- Stretch: Identify API's you would like to use!
